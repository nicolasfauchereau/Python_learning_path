# Python Learning Path 

Welcome to NIWA's **Python Learning Path** for [NIWA's Digital Learning Hub](https://niwa.sharepoint.com/sites/LearningM365/SitePages/Python.aspx), the material will be posted soon, following the below structure: 

+ Introduction, and solutions for installing Python (Anaconda preferred)
+ Python basics: Python as a general scripting language 
+ Python IDEs and notebooks
+ The core components of the Python Scientific Ecosystem (Numpy = data structures, Scipy =  scientific algorithms, Matplotlib = plotting)
+ Dealing with file formats in Python quick intro (from matlab files to netcdf)
+ Towards data science in Python: Pandas
+ Multidimensional labelled arrays: Xarray and Iri
+ More on plotting with Python: deeper dive in Matplotlib, statistical plots with seaborn, Geographic maps with Cartopy, interactive plotting solutions (e.g. the 'pyviz' ecosystem)
+ Python Machine Learning:
	- Quick introduction to Machine Learning
	- Scikit-learn
	- Deep Learning with Python: Tensorflow and Pytorch
+ High Performance Python
